    </ul>
    <h3>Unfortunately, I don't have any pets</h3>
    <p>My top picks for pets if I was going to get one would be in the following order</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hedgehog</li>
      <li>Ferret</li>
      <li>Cat</li>
    </ol>
    <P>Hopefully I've move into a new place soon that allows pets so I can have a furry friend to keep me company.</P>
    <P>If you're looking for new pets in Oregon, consider adopting from
